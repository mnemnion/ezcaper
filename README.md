# Ezcaper

A simple library for escaping strings and codepoints in format printing.

## Purpose

Debugging and logging, among other uses, often want to print a string in the style of a source-code string.  Zig has [std.zig.stringEscape](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.zig.stringEscape), but this escapes all non-ASCII input using `\xXX`-style escape sequences, which is valid Zig, but not ideal for seeing what a multi-byte string actually consists of.

The `ezcaper` library has several functions which serve to print strings, and codepoints, in a way which is valid Zig source code, but more legible, more like one might write the string naturally.

## Install

```sh
zig fetch --save https://github.com/mnemnion/ezcaper/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.tar.gz
```

## Design


The brains of the operation is the oddly-specific function whichControlKind, which answer with the enums `.control`, `.format`, and `.normal`.  This allows for strings and codepoints to have different behavior for format characters: escaped as codepoints and printed directly as strings.  This lets Farmer Bob "üë®üèª‚Äçüåæ" print as a single grapheme, while the ZWJ in Farmer Bob, in isolation, becomes '\u{200d}'.

The functions are code-generated from the Unicode Character Database data for version 17.0, and will be updated upon the occasion of subsequent versions of Unicode.  It uses a master switch to separate codepoints by power-of-two, this is likely somewhat less efficient than the lookup table employed by `zg`, with the compensating advantage that it's pure code with no allocations.

These are used to power a few structs, intended to be used in formatted printing. EscChar will print a single u21, using either `{}` or `{u}` as the format string. If it receives `u` it will print the character 'bare', otherwise it will surround it with a pair of quotes and write `'` as `\'`.  This will throw an error if the codepoint is too large.

There are two structs for printing escaped strings: EscStringExact and EscStringLossy. EscStringExact will print `\x` codes for any invalid Unicode data, while EscStringLossy will print the Unicode Replacement Character U+FFFD for any invalid sequences, following the recommended approach to substitution in the Unicode Standard.

Both may be called with `{}` and `{s}`, with the same sort of outcome: `s` will print the string without quotes, while the bare option will print the string in double-quotes and escape a double quote as `\"` and a backslash as `\\`.  Both use the escape sequences `\t`, `\r`, and `\n`, print ASCII C0 codes as `\xXX`, and all other escaped values in the `\u{XXXX}` format.

It is a bug if the string produced by EscStringExact does not read into Zig with a byte-identical result to the source string.  It is *not* a bug if zig fmt formats the result string differently from ezcaper.

Note that EscChar will escape surrogate codepoints, which is not (currently) valid in Zig source code.  The string printers will replace or byte-print surrogates, respectively, and this will change if and when escaped surrogates become valid in Zig strings, see issue #20270.

For convenient formatting, these structs can be created with helper functions `escChar`, `escStringExact`, and `escStringLossy`.  Example use:

```zig
std.debug.print("a string: {} and a char {u}", .{escStringExact(str), escChar(c)});
```

The mnemonic here is that `{s}` and `{u}` do the same thing which the standard library does, and `{}` does the fancier custom thing.


## Plans

I don't expect changes to this library at any point, other than to update the generated code each time Unicode releases a new standard.  If you see output which looks like a bug, and I agree, I'll fix that.

This module has [runerip](https://github.com/mnemnion/runeset) as a dependency, because the API makes handling both kinds of string print easier.  This dependency may be removed at some future point.
